# The Cozy Nation App

The Cozy Nation App is inspired by our cohort's love of dogs and all rescue animals.

The user is presented with a fun platform of pets and not-so-ordinary pets, with several options: 
* Book a Playdate: The user can book a play-date with the cute pet of their choice.
* Adopt: The user can adopt a pet and give him or her their forever home.
* Review: The user can rate and write a review of pets they have booked for play-dates and for pets they have adopted.

The Cozy Nation App implements Ruby on Rails MVC design structures and CRUD functionality.
